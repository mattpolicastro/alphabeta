# A/B Test Tool — Task Tracker

> **How to use this file:** Each module is self-contained. Agents should claim a module by marking tasks `[~]` (in progress). Before starting, read the **Depends on** line and confirm those items are merged to `main`. Mark `[x]` when merged. Use branch naming convention `feat/<module-slug>`.
>
> **Req doc reference:** `requirements.md` in repo root. Section numbers are cited inline as `§N.N`.
>
> **Architecture reference:** `architecture.md` in repo root — read this first for directory layout, data flow, and key conventions.

## Legend

- `[ ]` — Not started
- `[~]` — In progress (note who/which agent)
- `[x]` — Merged to main
- `[!]` — Blocked (note reason)
- `[-]` — Descoped / deferred to v2
- **P0** — Must land first; other modules depend on it
- **P1** — Core feature; can parallelize after P0
- **P2** — Important but not blocking other work
- **P3** — Polish / nice-to-have for v1

---

## v1 Remaining Gaps — Ready to Assign

> All tasks below are independent and can be parallelized. Read `architecture.md` first. Each task lists the files to touch and what "done" looks like.

### ~~Functional (affects user experience)~~ ✅ Complete

## Implementation Notes (deviations from requirements.md)

> These clarifications reflect decisions made during implementation. Agents should follow the actual codebase, not the original requirements, where they differ.

- **Routing:** Uses query params (`/experiments/view?id=X&view=upload`) not dynamic routes (`/experiments/[id]`). This is required for Next.js static export (`output: 'export'`).
- **Styling:** Raw Bootstrap 5 CSS classes via `className`. No `react-bootstrap` component library, no Tailwind.
- **gbstats API:** Class-based (`EffectBayesianABTest`, `TwoSidedTTest`, `ProportionStatistic`), NOT bare functions (`proportion_test`, `frequentist_test`) as requirements.md assumed. See `architecture.md`.
- **Pyodide:** Pinned to 0.26.2 (not 0.27.0) due to numpy 2.x conflict. gbstats installed with `deps=False`.
- **Sequential engine:** Deferred to v2. Type exists in schema but removed from all UI selectors.
- **CUPED:** Schema field preserved but toggle disabled in UI; not implemented in analysis logic.
- **File organization:** `lib/store/` (not `lib/stores/`), `lib/csv/buildRequest.ts` (not `lib/stats/buildRequest.ts`). DB operations are in `lib/db/index.ts` (not split into per-entity files). See `architecture.md` for actual layout.
- **Shared components:** Variation editing, stats config, and metric picker are extracted into shared components (`VariationEditor`, `StatsConfigEditor`, `MetricPicker`) used by both the wizard and config panel.
- **Test framework configured.** Jest + `next/jest` preset + `fake-indexeddb` + `@testing-library/react`. Run `npm test` from `apps/web/`. DB test isolation via `resetDb()` helper in `lib/db/__tests__/helpers.ts`.

### Module: CSV Parsing & Validation
Touches: `lib/csv/`
Req: §4.2, §4.3, §5.3

- [x] Dimension count soft warning (configurable threshold)
- [x] Column auto-classification: numeric heuristic for metric vs dimension
- [x] Tests: schema version rejection, missing columns, whitespace normalization, edge cases

> **Note:** PapaParse runs synchronously (not `worker: true`) since the CSV format is pre-aggregated and small. This is a deliberate simplification.

### Module: Column Mapping

### Module: Analysis Request Builder
Touches: `lib/csv/buildRequest.ts`
Req: §5.4, §6.3

- [x] Filter parsed CSV rows by current `experiment_id`
- [x] Compute rates: for `raw_total` metrics, multiply back by units for consistent engine handling; pass through `pre_normalized`
- [x] Construct `AnalysisRequest` payload: overall data + dimension slices
- [x] Handle `"all"` sentinel for dimension grouping
- [x] Tests: correct payload construction

> **Note:** `buildRequest.ts` lives in `lib/csv/`, not `lib/stats/` as the original TODO assumed.

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [x] CSV data held in memory only — never written to IndexedDB (§5.3, §11.2)
- [x] Dexie schema versioning (version 1 defined, ready for future migrations)
- [x] Browser compatibility: standard APIs, no vendor-specific code
- [ ] All IndexedDB operations wrapped in try/catch with user-facing error messages — partially done
- [x] Loading indicator for any operation > 500ms — global progress bar via `GlobalLoadingIndicator` + `loadingStore`
- [x] Inline tooltips for statistical concepts — `StatTooltip` component with 14 term wrappers across key components

---

## Dependency Graph (actual merge order)

All modules were developed on `main` (no feature branches). The commit history reflects the logical build order:

```
scaffold → next.js app → data model + stores → csv pipeline → stats engine
  → components → pages → lambda → demo + scripts → CI/CD
  → shared config components → ResultsTable + ColumnMapper
  → stats worker parity → validation panel + guardrail section
  → dimension slices + export features + architecture docs
```
